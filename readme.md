<h1>3D Kyykk√§ Court</h1>
<h3>Demo: </h3>
<p>	This was supposed to be just a learning experience messing around with three.js.
However, the outcome was pretty nice and was proven to be useful when training
referees for the kyykka champioships.</p>
<p>The code isn't good, but it suffices. The referee's won't see it ;)</p>
<p>TODO: someday refactor this with TypeScript...</p>
